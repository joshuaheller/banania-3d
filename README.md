## About the Game

Banania 3D is a homage to the original Banania computer game from Windows 95. The game was originally created by Rüdiger Appel and Markuß Golschinski and published by Data Becker.

In this game, you play as Berti, the garbage collector, who has been called into a warehouse to clean up after a runaway monkey. The monkey has hidden on the 51st floor and has left banana peels all over the floors. Your task is to collect all the banana peels while avoiding the garbage monsters.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to move Berti around the level.
2. Collect all banana peels to activate the exit.
3. Avoid the green and purple monsters - they will kill you if they touch you.
4. Push blocks to create paths or block monsters.
5. Collect keys to unlock doors with corresponding numbers.
6. Reach the exit after collecting all bananas to advance to the next level.
